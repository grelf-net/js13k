# js13k
This is my submission to the competition js13kGames 2022. As a zip file it occupies only 4.7kb

It was written from scratch in 10 days.

It uses my own algorithm for generating limitless 3D terrain which I devised around 1980. The first published version 
was The Forest, 1982, for TRS-80 Model 1 having only 16 kilobytes of programmable memory.

index.html is a web page which runs

amin.js which is a minified version of

a.js, my original JavaScript: plain old-style JS using a 2D canvas.

Images and sounds are created entirely within the JS. There are no external dependencies
.
